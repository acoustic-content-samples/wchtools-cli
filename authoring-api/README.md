# IBM Watson Content Hub Tools API module
This node module provides helper APIs to the IBM Watson Content Hub Tools.
It is for use by the node based IBM Watson Content Hub client tools only and is
not meant to be a documented and stable (non-changing) API for other tools.
This internal API may change over time, as needed by the tools.
