# Acoustic Content Tools API module
This node module provides helper APIs to the Acoustic Content Tools hosted at https://github.com/acoustic-content-samples/wchtools-cli .

It is for use by the node based Acoustic Content client tools only and is
not meant to be a documented and stable (non-changing) API for other tools.
This internal API may change over time, as needed by the tools.
